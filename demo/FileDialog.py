overview = """\
This class provides the file selection dialog. It incorporates OS-native features
depending on the OS in use, and can be used both for open and save operations.
The files displayed can be filtered by setting up a wildcard filter, multiple files
can be selected (open only), and files can be forced in a read-only mode.

There are two ways to get the results back from the dialog. GetFiles() returns only
the file names themselves, in a Python list. GetPaths() returns the full path and
filenames combined as a Python list.
