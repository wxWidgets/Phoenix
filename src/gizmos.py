# This is just a compatibility shim to make the gizmos classes usable from
# the wx.gizmos module, like in Classic.  They're actually in the wx.lib.gizmos
# package now.
#
# This module is deprecated and could be removed some time in the future. Please
# switch your imports to wx.lib.gizmos

from wx.lib.gizmos import *
