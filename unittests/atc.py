# Application Test Case
# Allows testing wx features within the context of an application

"""
Application Test Case allows python's unittest framework to run full wx 
applications within a test case with out any need to manually drive the main 
eventloop. This reduces buginess within tested features that require a running
mainloop, such as event-based behavior.

ATC accomplishes this by receiving a widget class and constructing a test case class
from the widget. When unittest invokes a test within this testcase the application
will be started and the test sequence will begin. 

The widget given to ATC will look like it is a test case itself, aside from a few 
nuances. Which are as follows:
1) The widget MUST derive from the given class: TestWidget
    This class provides the code necessary to automate tests and convey results.
    Furthermore, anything that derives TestWidget must also derive from at least wx.EventHandler
2) Some methods will need to be decorated with 'testCritical' to perform as expected.
    More on this later.
3) The ATC testcase class must be created and assigned to the global scope so unittest can detect it.
    This is performed with createATC(test_widget_derivation)

ATC requires some additional code in order to perform correctly. It needs:
1) to know which methods are critical. That is which ones are not allowed to have
  an exception escape their frame.
2) When a test fails or passes

First, a decorator method 'testCritical' is provided. this decorator will automatically fail 
the current test if an an unhandled exception occurs within the decorated function.
Secondly, TestWidget provides the methods TestWidget.testPassed and TestWidget.TestFailed
to specify a test result. When these methods are called the application will exit and 
results will be delivered to unittest

Important notes:
The TestCase class can be accessed using TestWidget.getTestCase(), this is usefull for 
utilizing standard testcase methods such as failUnless, assert____() and so on.
These TestCase methods will only work within testCritical methods. Otherwise 
the exceptions raised by them will pass silently into the Python/wx sandwhich.

# Benefits: As stated, allows unit testing within a full App mainloop.
#           Allows developers to quickly construct a test case by developing a
#               single widget
#           TestCase class is generated from the widget provided to atc. The
#               generated TestCase class  mimics the widget to allow pytest
#               to behave  normally. This allows  unsquashed testing (jamming
#               plural tests into one runtime)
#           Generated TestCase class should play nice with all unittest features
#           Generated TestCase classes are unique, allowing plural per test
#               module

# TODO:
#   Ensure full TestCase API is available within the app
#   automatically apply TestCritical decorator to test_ methods in widget
#   Explore option of having the same application instance runn all test sequences.

    Creates and returns a class that derives unittest.TestCase the TestCase is generated from widget
    IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for the returned class to be picked up by the default unittest TestDiscovery process
        the returned class must be assigned to the main module's base level namespace
    If widget is not top level  (does not drive from wx.Frame) a container top level widget will be created

            itself as a parameter to widget.__init__ (for assigning parent)

    The returned class will have test_ methods to match those of the widget class, all decorations are preserved
        so it is perfectly valid to apply unittest decorators (such as unittest.expectedFailure) to the widget class
        as such decorations will be reflected by the TestCase class methods and utilized during testing.
