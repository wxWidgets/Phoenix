    Manages notifications for tracing pubsub activity. When pubsub takes a
    certain action such as sending a message or creating a topic, and
    the notification flag for that activity is True, all registered
    notification handlers get corresponding method called with information
    about the activity, such as which listener subscribed to which topic.
    See INotificationHandler for which method gets called for each activity.

    If more than one notification handler has been registered, the order in
    which they are notified is unspecified (do not rely on it).

    Note that this manager automatically unregisters all handlers when
    the Python interpreter exits, to help avoid NoneType exceptions during
    shutdown. This "shutdown" starts when the last line of app "main" has
    executed; the Python interpreter then starts cleaning up, garbage
    collecting everything, which could lead to various pubsub notifications
    -- by then they should be of no interest -- such as dead
    listeners, etc.
