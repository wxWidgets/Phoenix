        By default, pubsub will accept topic names for topics that
        don't have a message data specification (MDS). This default behavior
        makes pubsub easier to use initially, but allows topic
        names with typos to go uncaught in common operations such as
        sendMessage() and subscribe(). In a large application, this
        can lead to nasty bugs. Pubsub's default behavior is equivalent
        to setTopicUnspecifiedFatal(false).

        When called with newVal=True, any future pubsub operation that
        requires a topic (such as subscribe and sendMessage) will require
        an MDS; if none is available, pubsub will raise a TopicDefnError
        exception.

        If checkExisting is not given or True, all existing
        topics are validated. A TopicDefnError exception is
        raised if one is found to be incomplete (has hasMDS() false).

        Returns previous value of newVal.

        Note that this method can be used in several ways:

        1. Only use it in your application when something is not working
           as expected: just add a call at the beginning of your app when
           you have a problem with topic messages not being received
           (for instance), and remove it when you have fixed the problem.

        2. Use it from the beginning of your app and never use newVal=False:
           add a call at the beginning of your app and you leave it in
           (forever), and use Topic Definition Providers to provide the
           listener specifications. These are easy to use via the
           pub.addTopicDefnProvider().

        3. Use it as in #1 during app development, and once stable, use
           #2. This is easiest to do in combination with
           pub.exportTopicTreeSpec().
